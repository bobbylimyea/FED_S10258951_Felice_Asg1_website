This is my FED Assignment 1

I made a healthy living website for my assignment and i chose to do this because i want to spread the awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. i have realised that the recent trends of people having unhealthy lifestyle has been increasing at an alarming rate.
My target audiences are teenagers(13-18years old), adults(21-50 years old), elderlies(65 and above). In my website, i have 5 webpages, mental health, home page, exercise and nutrition. These few factors help to contribute into helping everyone have a healthy lifestyle. Lastly, i also have made a contact webpage just in case audiences have any questions that they have after visiting our website and would like to know more about healthy living, they can always leave their questions and particulars there so that we can respond to them.
